I learned how to create keylogger and how to send files from host to a server.

## Pre-Installed

- requests (for host machine)
- flask (for server machine)

## How to run

- Run the server:
```
cd server
source venv/bin/activate
puthon server.py

```
- Send file to server:
```
python sender.py
```
