# Lab 8: Vim Editor

## Completed Work
Got familiar with the **Vim** text editor, its modes, and basic editing commands:
- installed Vim using the command `sudo apt install vim`
- created a test file `file.txt`
- opened the file in Vim
- explored and tried different modes: Normal, Insert, Visual, Command
- added and deleted lines (`i`, `dd`, `:%d`)
- saved changes (`:w`)
- exited the editor (`:q`, `:wq`)

Additionally, by using the command (`vimtutor`) and Google, I tried other commands in the editor.
